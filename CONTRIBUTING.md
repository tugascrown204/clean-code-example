# Contributing to Clean Code Example

Thank you for considering contributing to this project! We appreciate your interest in helping us improve.

## How to Contribute
1. **Fork the Repository**: Create your own copy of the repository by forking it.
2. **Create a Branch**: Use a descriptive branch name that relates to your changes, e.g., `fix-typo` or `add-python-example`.
3. **Make Your Changes**: Implement your changes in your branch.
4. **Write Tests**: If applicable, ensure your changes are covered by tests. **Prefer unit tests to verify functionality and integration tests to ensure components interact correctly. Tests should be clear, easy to understand, and effectively demonstrate the intended use cases. Ensure that your tests are runnable in the existing test framework.** Additionally, document any new tests. If adding tests that cover new functionality, clearly indicate the purpose of each test and consider creating a dedicated test documentation file to explain the comprehensive test coverage.
5. **Submit a Pull Request**: Go to the original repository and submit a PR describing your changes.
